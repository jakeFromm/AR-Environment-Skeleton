### Questions from Caryn
 
 
 - ActiveRecord created .all methods
 - I had to create #full_name and #tenure methods
 - In short, AR creates all reader methods for defined attributes. More complex methods need to be defined by dev

 ### Deliverables Part 2

  - changed belongs_to to has_many_through
  - created a GradeLevel table
